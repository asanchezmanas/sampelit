## Guidelines

1. **Never cherry-pick results** - Publish everything, including inconclusive tests
2. **Be honest about limitations** - Sample size, external factors, etc.
3. **Make it actionable** - What can readers apply to their own sites?
4. **Link to methodology** - Reference the testing approach for credibility
5. **Update if needed** - If long-term results differ, add an update
