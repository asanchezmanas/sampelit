## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Understated Confidence
We don't need to convince you we're good. We show you.

```
✗ "The most powerful A/B testing platform on the market"
✓ "Copy testing infrastructure for teams that prefer data over opinions"
```

### 2. Honest About Limitations
Transparency builds trust with sophisticated buyers.

```
✗ "Guaranteed to increase your conversions"
✓ "Most tests are inconclusive. That's a valid result."

✗ "Works for any business"
✓ "Requires at least 2,000 monthly visitors for reliable results"
```

### 3. Technical But Accessible
Explain the methodology without jargon.

```
✗ "Leveraging Bayesian multi-armed bandit algorithms"
✓ "Variants that perform well receive more traffic automatically"

✗ "AI-powered optimization engine"
✓ "Adaptive allocation based on real-time performance"
```

### 4. Anti-Hype
Sophisticated buyers are allergic to marketing speak.

```
NEVER USE:
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "Skyrocket"
- "10x your business"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Join thousands of satisfied customers"
- Exclamation marks in headlines
- Emojis in primary copy
```

### 5. European Craftsmanship
Quality, precision, thoughtfulness.

```
✓ "Built in Barcelona"
✓ "Methodology documented"
✓ "Results cryptographically verifiable"
```

## Tone by Channel

| Channel | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Website | Calm, authoritative | "We test our own landing pages." |
| Blog | Educational, data-driven | "Research shows..." |
| Email | Direct, helpful | "Your experiment reached significance." |
| Instagram | Visual proof, minimal text | Dashboard screenshots, data visualizations |
| Ads | Curiosity, not hype | "This page is running an experiment right now." |

## Headlines Formula

**Structure:** [What it does] + [for whom] + [differentiator]

```
✓ "Copy testing infrastructure for teams that prefer data over opinions."
✓ "A/B testing for copy. €49/month. No sales calls."
✓ "We test our own landing pages with the same system we offer."
```

**Avoid:**
```
✗ "The Ultimate A/B Testing Solution for Modern Marketers"
✗ "Boost Your Conversions with AI-Powered Testing"
```

---

## CTAs

**Primary:** "See the live demo" / "Try the simulator"
**Secondary:** "Join waitlist" / "Read the documentation"

**Avoid:**
```
✗ "Start Free Trial Now!"
✗ "Get Started Today!"
✗ "Claim Your Spot!"
```

## Formatting Rules

1. **No exclamation marks** in headlines or primary copy
2. **Sentence case** for headlines (not Title Case)
3. **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
4. **White space** is intentional (don't fill every pixel)
5. **Links are subtle** (no "CLICK HERE" buttons)
