### When to Choose Optimizely

Optimizely makes sense if:

- You have a dedicated experimentation team (3+ people)
- You need advanced personalization and targeting
- You require feature flags integrated with A/B testing
- You're running 50+ experiments simultaneously
- Budget isn't a primary constraint
- You need enterprise compliance (SOC2, specific SLAs)

---

### When to Choose Sampelit

Sampelit makes sense if:

- You're a startup or SMB without a dedicated CRO team
- You want to start testing this week, not next quarter
- You need straightforward A/B and copy testing
- Monthly billing and flexibility matter
- You prefer Bayesian statistics (faster decisions)
- Your budget is under €10k/year for testing tools

---

### What You Won't Get With Sampelit

We believe in being direct about limitations:

- **No personalization engine** — We do A/B testing, not dynamic content
- **No feature flags** — Use LaunchDarkly or similar if you need this
- **No server-side testing** — Client-side only for now
- **Fewer integrations** — We cover the essentials, not everything
- **No dedicated CSM** — Until Enterprise tier

If these are dealbreakers, Optimizely (or VWO, AB Tasty) may be better fits.

---

### Switching from Optimizely

If you're currently on Optimizely and considering switching:

1. **Your data stays yours** — Export your historical results before canceling
2. **Similar setup** — Visual Editor works similarly; learning curve is minimal
3. **No migration tool** — You'll recreate experiments (most take 5-10 minutes each)
4. **Parallel run** — Consider running both for 1 month during transition

### When to Choose VWO

VWO makes sense if:

- You want testing + qualitative tools in one platform
- Heatmaps and session recordings are important to your workflow
- You need advanced targeting and segmentation
- You prefer one vendor for the entire optimization stack
- You have budget for the full suite (~$1,000+/month)

---

### When to Choose Sampelit

Sampelit makes sense if:

- You want focused A/B testing without the extra tools
- You already use Hotjar/FullStory/etc. for qualitative data
- You prefer paying only for what you use
- You want simpler pricing without per-product fees
- You're a smaller team that doesn't need advanced targeting

---

### What You Won't Get With Sampelit

- **No heatmaps** — Use Hotjar, FullStory, or Microsoft Clarity
- **No session recordings** — Same as above
- **No surveys** — Use Typeform, Hotjar, or similar
- **No form analytics** — VWO's Form Analytics is genuinely useful if you have complex forms

We focus on testing. For qualitative tools, we recommend dedicated solutions.

# Sampelit vs Google Optimize

Google Optimize was discontinued in September 2023. Here's how Sampelit compares as a replacement.

**TL;DR:** Sampelit offers similar core functionality (A/B testing, visual editor) with better statistics and no Google Analytics dependency.

---

### Quick Comparison

| | Sampelit | Google Optimize (discontinued) |
|---|----------|-------------------------------|
| **Price** | €149/month+ | Free (was) |
| **Status** | Active | Discontinued Sept 2023 |

---

### Why Google Optimize Users Switch to Sampelit

**1. No Google Analytics lock-in**

Google Optimize required GA. Sampelit works with any analytics tool—or none.

**2. No experiment limits**

Optimize free was limited to 5 simultaneous experiments. Sampelit starts at 5 and scales to unlimited.

**3. Better support**

Optimize had no direct support for free users. Sampelit includes email support on all plans.

**4. Similar workflow**

If you used Optimize's Visual Editor, Sampelit's will feel familiar. Setup takes 10 minutes.

---

### What's Different

| Feature | Sampelit | Google Optimize |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Free tier | No (14-day trial) | Yes (was) |
| GA integration | Optional | Required |
| Personalization | No | Yes (Optimize 360) |
| Audience from GA | No | Yes |
| Container-based | No | Yes |

---

### Migration from Google Optimize

1. **Export your data** — Download historical results from Optimize before it's gone
2. **Install Sampelit** — Add one script tag to your site
3. **Recreate experiments** — Use Visual Editor to rebuild active tests
4. **No GA changes needed** — Sampelit tracks independently

Most migrations take 1-2 hours for 5-10 experiments.
