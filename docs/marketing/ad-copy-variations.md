### Ad Set 1: Professional/Direct

**Audience:** Marketing managers, growth leads, founders

#### Variant A — ROI Focus

**Intro text:**
```
Your homepage headline is seen by every visitor.

A 10% improvement in conversion = 10% more customers from the same traffic.

Most teams never test it because "testing is complicated."

It doesn't have to be.
```

**Headline:** A/B test your headlines in 10 minutes

**Description:** No code required. Bayesian statistics. €149/month.

**CTA:** Learn More

---

#### Variant B — Competitor Comparison

**Intro text:**
```
Optimizely is built for enterprises with dedicated CRO teams.

If you're a startup or SMB who just wants to test headlines and CTAs, you don't need all that.

Sampelit: the testing essentials, without the enterprise overhead.
```

**Description:** Visual editor. Real statistics. Monthly billing.

**CTA:** Learn More

---

#### Variant C — Problem/Solution

**Intro text:**
```
"Should we change the headline?"

Without data, it's just opinions in a meeting room.

With A/B testing, it's a clear answer in 2-3 weeks.

Set up your first test today. No enterprise contract required.
```

**Headline:** Replace opinions with data

**Description:** A/B testing starting at €149/month.

#### Variant A — Contrarian

**Intro text:**
```
Controversial take: Most A/B tests are inconclusive.

That's not failure. That's information.

An inconclusive test tells you the difference isn't big enough to matter—so you can move on to higher-leverage changes.

The goal isn't "winners." It's learning faster.
```

**Headline:** Rethinking A/B test success

**Description:** Built for teams who test to learn, not just to win.

**CTA:** Learn More

---

#### Variant B — Anti-Hype

**Intro text:**
```
We won't promise to "skyrocket your conversions" or "unlock exponential growth."

We'll help you find out if version A or B performs better.

Then you decide what to do with that information.

Testing tools should give you data, not hype.
```

**Headline:** A/B testing without the marketing BS

**Description:** Data, not promises. Starting at €149/month.

**CTA:** Learn More
