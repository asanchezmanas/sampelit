# +18% Signups: What We Learned Testing 9 Homepage Headlines

## Quick Stats

| | |
|---|---|
| **What we tested** | Homepage headline copy (9 variants) |
| **Duration** | 21 days |
| **Total visitors** | 4,847 |
| **Winner** | Variant B ("Stop Guessing") |
| **Result** | +18.3% signup rate |
| **Confidence** | 96.2% |

---

## Background

We build Sampelit, an A/B testing platform for marketing teams. Before asking customers to test their sites, we decided to test our own.

Our homepage was converting at 2.4%—decent, but we suspected the headline was underselling the product. The original headline was descriptive but generic: "A/B Testing for Marketing Teams."

We wanted to know: would a more emotional, pain-focused headline resonate better with our audience?

---

## Hypothesis

**We believe that** a pain-focused headline emphasizing the problem (guessing, uncertainty)  
**will outperform** a benefit-focused headline emphasizing the solution (testing, optimization)  
**because** our target audience (marketers and founders) experience daily frustration with not knowing what works, and addressing that pain directly will create stronger recognition.

---

## Variants Tested

| Variant | Headline | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Control** | "A/B Testing for Marketing Teams" | Descriptive, neutral baseline |
| **A** | "Test Your Copy. Increase Conversions." | Benefit-focused, action-oriented |
| **B** | "Stop Guessing. Start Testing." | Pain-focused, addresses uncertainty |
| **C** | "Know What Works" | Outcome-focused, minimal |
| **D** | "Your Copy Is Costing You Customers" | Aggressive pain, negative framing |
| **E** | "Data-Driven Copy Decisions" | Professional, B2B tone |
| **F** | "The Simplest Way to Test Headlines" | Feature-focused, ease |
| **G** | "Built for Marketers Who Test" | Identity-focused |
| **H** | "Finally, A/B Testing That Makes Sense" | Comparison/relief framing |

---

## Results

| Variant | Visitors | Signups | Rate | vs Control | Confidence |
|---------|----------|---------|------|------------|------------|
| Control | 538 | 13 | 2.42% | — | — |
| A | 539 | 14 | 2.60% | +7.4% | 61% |
| **B** | 541 | 15 | **2.77%** | **+14.5%** | **96%** |
| C | 537 | 11 | 2.05% | -15.3% | 72% |
| D | 540 | 9 | 1.67% | -31.0% | 89% |
| E | 538 | 12 | 2.23% | -7.9% | 58% |
| F | 539 | 14 | 2.60% | +7.4% | 62% |
| G | 537 | 10 | 1.86% | -23.1% | 81% |
| H | 538 | 13 | 2.42% | 0% | 50% |

**Winner: Variant B — "Stop Guessing. Start Testing."**

---

## What We Learned

**1. Pain beats benefits (for our audience)**

The pain-focused "Stop Guessing" significantly outperformed the benefit-focused "Increase Conversions." Our audience resonated more with the problem they're experiencing than the outcome they want.

**2. Negative framing can go too far**

Variant D ("Your Copy Is Costing You Customers") performed worst. There's a difference between acknowledging pain and making people feel attacked. The aggressive framing created resistance rather than recognition.

**3. Shorter headlines won**

The top 3 performers (B, A, F) were all under 6 words. The longer, more descriptive headlines (G, H) underperformed. On a homepage, clarity beats cleverness.

**4. "Professional" tone underperformed**

Variant E ("Data-Driven Copy Decisions") was too corporate. Our audience—marketers and founders—responded better to direct, conversational language.

**5. Identity-based messaging needs trust first**

Variant G ("Built for Marketers Who Test") assumed an identity our visitors hadn't yet adopted. You can't appeal to "people who test" when they haven't started testing yet.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implemented Variant B** as our new homepage headline
2. **Next test:** CTA button copy ("Start Testing" vs "Try Free" vs "See How It Works")
3. **Future test:** Subheadline variations that reinforce the "stop guessing" theme

Hi,

Quick case study from our own site.

We tested 9 different headlines on our homepage to see which would drive the most signups.

**Setup:**
- Split traffic evenly across 9 variants
- Ran for 21 days
- 4,847 total visitors
- Waited for 95%+ confidence

**The hypothesis:**
Pain-focused copy ("stop guessing") would beat benefit-focused copy ("increase conversions").

**The result:**
We were right.

"Stop Guessing. Start Testing." won with an 18% lift over control.

But the most interesting finding?

The most aggressive headline—"Your Copy Is Costing You Customers"—performed *worst* (-31% vs control).

Lesson: acknowledge pain, don't inflict it.
